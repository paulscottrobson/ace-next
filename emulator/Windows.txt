The shambles that is Windows seems to now require

	libwinpthread-1.dll
	sdl2.dll

which are in a ZIP file in case they get removed by github.

It also requires, to build (I installed using chocolatey)

	Mingw32
	Make
	SDL2 x64 bit copied to c:\ so c:\sdl2 has bin include lib share in it

and lots of faffing about.

Linux, of course, compiled it just the same as it has done for years.
