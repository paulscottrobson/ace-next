The shambles that is Windows seems to now require

	libwinpthread-1.dll
	sdl2.dll

which are in a ZIP file in case they get removed by github.

It also requires, to build (I installed using chocolatey)

	Mingw32
	Make
	SDL2 x64 bit copied to c:\ so c:\sdl2 has bin include lib share in it

and lots of faffing about.

Linux, of course, compiled it just the same as it has done for years.

This was built on 8.1 in VirtualBox (which didn't initially work because Windows
had decided arbitrarily the driver signing was out of date) so it'll probably work
in Windows 10 and Windows Paintjob.

But who knows ?
