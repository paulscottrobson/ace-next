Introduction
Help the five friendly forgs to cross the busy road, avoid the snake in
the grass, navigate the river without getting wet - and into their safe
little homes - the holes in the far side of the bank.

The objective is to get each frog into a home without losing any in
nasty accidents on the way

Instructions
Steer each frog (controls displayed during the program) through the
hazards within the time allowed. The time remaining is shown graphically
at the bottom of the screen.

In case of emergency you can disappear off one side of the screen and
reappear on the other - but you lose points for doing so.

The grass is a safe resting place, but watch out for the hungry snake !

Turtles are good to use as stepping stones in the river but when they
turn white they are getting ready to dive - and our friendly frogs would
drown if they fell in the water !

You have only three lives, and things get more difficult as the game
gets going !
