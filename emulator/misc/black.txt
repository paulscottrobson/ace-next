Black Island Adventure by Phil Collins and Geoffrey Waller
(C) Boldfield Computing Ltd 1984

Load and run the program by entering
        load black island

Further instructions telling you when to STOP or reSTART the tape appear
on the screen and should be obeyed immediately. The adventure consists of
four chapters in all, the first one taking place in THE PORT (known
as section ..por)

HOW TO PLAY

To move around, use compoass points and up or down. These are entered
simply as U D N NE E .... etc. The program also understands a wide range
of other commands and these are either single word actions (such as
DISEMBARK) or two work phrases (such as KILL PARROT). You can pick up
and put down objects using GET,TAKE,DROP etc. and you can check what
you are carrying by entering INV (for Inventory). You can check where
you are by entering LOOK.

Of course, there are many more useful words which you must discover for
yourself ! The program will not allow you to miss out chapters, but it
will permit you to move on even though you are not fully equipped to do
so ! To complete the adventure in the most successful way is fairly
difficult, and provides the player with many hours of fun and
frustration.
