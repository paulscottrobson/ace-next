Introduction

It was a nasty day to be caught out on the moors as dusk fell. Worse still
you are all alone, searated from the rest when the storm broke. Luckily
you came across some shelter.

HAUNTED HALL it said on the broken nameplate, as you swung open the huge
oak door and stepped into the dank passageway. Strange to see so many
coffins about the place.

That's funny, the way out has just vanished ... 'better take a look
upstairs. Not much here, just a few more coffins and a bundle of old
boomerangs ... let's try the attic ...

Instructions

Escape !

HINT

The attic has 100 rooms, each has a nasty ghost and most have
poltergeists as well ! Some rooms contain useful items (collected
by positioning over them). Each room is slightly different, and
they are interconnected by doorways (in the walls) and
passageways (in the floors). Your only efence is by moving
out of the way, or by throwing a boomerang in the opposite
direction to your movement.

If you make it to the MAZE, you must be good enough to get out without
any more tips !

Joystick Control

Up, Down, Left and Right are the only directions allowed.
The fire button can be used in place of ENTER.
