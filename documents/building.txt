Executables
-----------

Windows has the DLLs installed and should just run.

Mac/Linux requires SDL2 to be installed to run.

Building
--------

Builds will require ; the gcc compiler, SDL2, ruby

Installing on ESP32 requires PlatformIO. 

On my system it works straight off because there's only one USB serial 
port. If you have more than one USB serial porrt you might have to tell
platformio which to use. See platformio docs.

Software
--------

TAP files go in the 'storage' directory under the directory the emulator
is run from. If you use the makefile to build ESP32 it will copy files from 
here to esp32/data for building. 

ESP32 tap files are loaded into SPIFFS.

Windows
-------

The shambles that is Windows seems to now require

	libwinpthread-1.dll
	sdl2.dll

which are in a ZIP file in case they get removed by github.

It also requires, to build (I installed most of it using chocolatey)

	Mingw32
	Make
	Ruby
	SDL2 x64 bit copied to c:\ so c:\sdl2 has bin include lib share in it

and lots of faffing about.

This was built on 8.1 in VirtualBox (which didn't initially work because Windows
had decided arbitrarily the driver signing was out of date) so it'll probably work
in Windows 10 and Windows Paintjob.

But who knows ?

If Windows is difficult about platformio/make in general ignore the makefile and run the last 
two instructions in the makefile from the ESP32 directory

	pio lib install 6143 	
	pio run -t upload
